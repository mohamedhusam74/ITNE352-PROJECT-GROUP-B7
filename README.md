# Project Title
Real-Time News Aggregation System with Interactive Client-Server Communication

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a real-time news aggregation system that uses an interactive client-server architecture to give consumers access to the most recent news sources and headlines. The system uses the NewsAPI to retrieve and present current content that is customized for the user, including news that has been filtered by keywords, categories, nations, or languages.

With the help of the client application's simple design, users may browse menus, look at news headlines, and investigate news sources. After processing client queries, the server interacts with the NewsAPI to retrieve the necessary information and provides the client with structured responses. The project places a strong emphasis on user-focused design, effective server-client communication, and dynamic data retrieval.

The server will be used to recieve requests from the client. For the server script, I made 3 files for the server code, configration and the expector. first function handler is used to Handles communication with a connected client and it contains 2 paremeters which are clientSoc, clientName, the clientSoc is the Socket object for client communication and clientName for the name of the connected client. Were we used the socket, json, requests, threading and extractors as the packages.
